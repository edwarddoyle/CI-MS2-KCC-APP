## Testing

JavaScript function testing can be found in the [JavaScript Test Results Document](assets/docs/FunctionTests.pdf)
As DRY functions are imported across the entire application - they are tested within the scope they are executed, ie. a noData() function is called when there is no data to display in events.js & reports.js. Testing of this function was carried out within these scopes and not where the function is declared

### Performance Testing

Performance testing was carried out using GTmetrix & Lighthouse. The initial results were very impressive but there were areas for improvement. Full test results are available to view in the [Performance & Accessibility Test Result Document](assets/docs/Tests.pdf). The biggest performance inhibitor is related to a 3rd party library - [Swiper JS](https://swiperjs.com/). I am currently researching Vanilla Javascript solutions for providing the same functionality as this library.

### Open issues

Some minor issues in regards to ARIA and a11y are present throughout the site. I aim to have these issues fixed once my knowledge and skills improve. Results of a11y testing can be found in the [Performance & Accessibility Test Result Document](assets/docs/Tests.pdf). I am waiting for feedback from users to identify further areas for improvement.
