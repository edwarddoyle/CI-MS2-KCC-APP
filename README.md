## Overview

>The Kilmacow Community Clean Up App was developed in partnership with the Kilmacow Community Clean Up Group. Following on from the success of the  [KCC website](https://edwarddoyle.github.io/CI-MS1-KCC/), the group immediately began formulating plans to further develop the site and provide users with a more engaging experience. The idea of a web application was proposed. The web app allows users to contribute to the group by reporting ‘blackspots for litter’, ‘areas for improvement’ and general issues in the community that the Community Clean Up Group could address or forward onto the appropriate authorities, such as the local council.

## UX

### User Stories

>#### First Time Vistiors

* "I would like to inform the group of a litter issue or area for improvement"

* "I would like to upload photos to provide evidence of my concern"

* "I would like to location stamp the area of concern"

>#### Returning Visitors

* "I would like to see if any events have been added / updated since my last visit"

* "I would like to contact the KCC group about future project ideas"

* "Whilst the app is in it's testing phase, I would like to provide feedback regarding design, functionality and ideas for future features"

### Strategy

>#### Project goals

* Develop and deploy a minimal viable product to explore the viability of a fully functioning web application. The goal of the app is to be tranformed into a progressive web app (PWA)

* Clean UI / UX for simple navigation. Visitors are from a traditionally non-web-savvy demographic.

* Gather feedback to influence the future design and features of the app

>#### Customer goals

* Increase user engagement by providing a platform for users to contribute to the group

* Increase feedback from members

* Easy to navigate application / fimiliar interface

* Incorporate existing branding and colour scheme

### Scope

* The client has requested a web application with a clean, uncluttered layout that has a sense of familiarity. The app should incorporate branding and style elements of the existing website.

* The client has requested I take full ownership of the development and maintenance of the site. 

* Once the app is deployed and the KCC members begin using it, a period of time will be allowed to measure the uptake and feedback from the users. This will determine if further resources will be invested the application. 

* As my coding skills develop the future features will be added to the app.

### Structure

The application aims to look and feel like a native application. The app is designed in the style and framework of a SPA (Single Page Application). Upon opening the app, the user will be greeted with the 'Home Section'. This section is designed to welcome returning users and in future releases act like a social media feed with news and updates. New users will be greeted with information about the app and permission requests that will be required in order to upload photos, access their camera and provide gps for location tracking. The aim is to inform the user so they are not suspicious or unsure when the browser requests such permissions. The navigation of the app will be based upon a card system layout, the hope is it will provide familiarity to the user and will allow for adding new features without redesigning the interface. Each of the cards represents a different feature and section of the app. These cards include: "Home","Report", "Events", "Contact".

#### Home: 

#### Reports: 

#### Events:
